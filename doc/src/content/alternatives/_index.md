Outcome [started life in 2014]({{% relref "/history" %}}), entered Boost as Boost.Outcome in 2018, and therefore was amongst the very first of the major alternative error handling frameworks to C++ exception throws in C++. Since then, and sometimes in reaction to Outcome's choice of design, alternative frameworks have appeared. This page tries to give a fairly even handed summary of those alternatives, and how they compare to Outcome in this author's opinion.
